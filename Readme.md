Future Shooter

Future Shooter is a futuristic top down shooter with both a single player and a multiplayer mode.

In single player the player fends off the police by blasting them with lazer beams.

When a player runs out of lives, they lose the game.

The aim is to see how many police the player can take on at once.

In multiplayer, the two players play together using split screen. Each player has four cars and needs to protect their base. If one player gets too close to an opposing players base, the cars on standby will begin to shoot. When a player dies they simply switch to the next available car, if there is one.

The first player to blast all the other players cars wins.

The game can be run by double clicking the Future Shooter executable found in the bin folder.
